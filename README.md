# Netflix-Prop-Storage
## A theoretical solution for efficient prop storage surrounding the Netflix production of The Crown.

Find the [Project Report](https://github.com/Matt-HarveyCook/Netflix-Prop-Storage/blob/main/NEA%20Report%20Matthew%20Cook.pdf) for a more comprehensive write up of the project development.

This is a project which I developed as a component of my Computer Science A-Level NEA. The concept was inspired by the difficulties a family friend experienced while working on The Crown. My project hoped to improve the efficiency of finding and storing props within a warehouse by uniquely identifying each item with a unique ID and barcode, allowing workers to efficiently catalogue and find available stock.

### Project Objectives:
1. Produce an easy to use interface which allows access to the MySQL database
2. Allow additional props to be added to the database easily through filling of a form
3. Accomodate not only the props owned by the production but also the storing of hired props which have to be returned

### Skills Developed:
* Greater comfort using Java and knowledge of the OOP paradigm
* Experience with SQL queries such as inner joins and management of an SQL database
* Designing a front end application which required consideration of both UI and UX
